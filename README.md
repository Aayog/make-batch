# make-batch
Simple python program. This creates a batch script that when executed in command prompt with 'filename of python program' as argument, will execute the python program.
The batch script modifies the traditional 'python [filename].py' to 'p [filename]'.
This has many limitations like they should be in same folder and its not too user-friendly.
